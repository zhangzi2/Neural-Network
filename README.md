# Neural Network

This repository contains Python implementations of various concepts from neural networks. The purpose of this repository is help me learn concepts related to neural networks and deep learning. The pdf is a working "cliff note" attempting to summarize Michael Nielsen's book Neural Networks and Deep Learning. As I read through more of the book, the pdf notes will expand and (hopefully) more code will be added as well.
